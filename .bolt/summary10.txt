Conversation Summary
We've been working on improving the SunSip application's room preview and scrolling experience. Here's what we accomplished:

Key Issues Addressed:
Room Preview Positioning: Fixed the preview room in the landing section to show the correct top portion instead of the middle, ensuring it matches the actual room dimensions from the results section.

Room Component Consistency: Made the preview room exactly the same size as the room in the results section, since it's essentially the same room but without data (empty state).

Scrolling Experience: Improved the transition from landing to results by:

Making the results section always rendered but controlling visibility with opacity
Tying the scroll action to the loading state completion
Adding smooth fade-in transitions when results become ready
Ensuring content is fully loaded before scrolling begins
Technical Changes Made:
Room.tsx: Enabled full parallax effects and animations for both preview and full modes, with conditional data display
MainScroller.tsx: Enhanced scroll logic to wait for !isLoading state, added opacity transitions, and improved timing
Preview Section: Adjusted positioning to show the top portion of the room correctly
Result:
The application now provides a much smoother user experience where the preview room seamlessly transitions to the full results room, with proper loading states and smooth scrolling behavior.
