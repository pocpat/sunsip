Project Overview
We've been working on SunSip, a weather-based cocktail recommendation app that suggests drinks based on your city's weather and local culture. The app features a beautiful room visualization with dynamic weather effects.

Key Layout Structure Implemented

┌─────────────────────┐
│   Landing Page      │ ← 80vh (search & title)
├─────────────────────┤
│   Room Preview      │ ← 20vh (top 20% of room only)
├─────────────────────┤
│   Full Results      │ ← 100vh (non-auth) / 120vh (auth)
│   (Room + Details)  │
└─────────────────────┘
Major Changes Made
1. Layout Architecture
Fixed Header: Logo and navigation always visible on top
MainScroller Component: Handles the scrolling between sections
Three-Section Layout: Landing (80vh) → Room Preview (20vh) → Full Results (100vh+)
Dashboard Modal: Overlay system for user dashboard instead of separate page
2. Navigation & Scrolling
Auto-scroll: Automatically scrolls to results when data loads
Scroll Prevention: Users can't manually scroll between sections
Smart Reset: "Start Over" button and logo click reset to landing
Seamless Transitions: Room preview is the actual top portion of the full room
3. Room Component Enhancements
Preview Mode: Shows empty room with blue glass window placeholder
Full Mode: Shows room with real weather data and cocktail
Fixed Sizing: Removed weird scaling issues in preview
Proper Positioning: Uses -top-[80%] to show only top 20% in preview
4. State Management
Simplified Views: Changed from 3 views to 2 (main and dashboard)
Data-Driven Display: Results section only shows when data is available
Scroll Coordination: Automatic scrolling based on data state
