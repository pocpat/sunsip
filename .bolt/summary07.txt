Our conversation has focused on enhancing the user experience and visual design of the SunSip application, particularly concerning loading animations and page transitions.

Initially, we discussed general design principles, emphasizing the creation of production-worthy and aesthetically pleasing web pages. The conversation then quickly shifted to refining the loading animation, specifically the loadingPrev10.png image. The user requested that this image scroll up from the very bottom of the screen, rather than from a fixed position, and that the animation not repeat infinitely.

Following this, the discussion evolved to integrate this scrolling concept into the main application flow. The plan was to have the ResultsPage (now ResultsPage.tsx) scroll up from the beginning, initially displaying placeholder images that would then be replaced by actual content once loaded.

The most recent update confirmed the implementation of this plan. Key changes included:

App.tsx: The main loading animation was removed, and the app now directly renders pages based on the currentView state.
LandingPage.tsx: The city selection process was streamlined, and the loadingPrev10.png image was repurposed for a scroll-up effect on this page.
ResultsPage.tsx: This page now features a smooth scroll-up animation from the bottom, providing a more fluid transition.
Room.tsx: A new isPreview prop was introduced to manage the display of placeholder images versus real content, ensuring a seamless visual experience during data loading.
Header.tsx and Footer.tsx: These components were updated and added respectively to enhance the overall UI consistency and navigation.
The overall goal has been to create a more integrated and visually appealing loading and transition experience for the user.
