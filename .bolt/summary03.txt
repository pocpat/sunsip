Project Context: Working on SunSip, a React/TypeScript web application that suggests cocktails based on weather and location, using Supabase for data storage.

Main Activities:

Test Debugging: Fixed multiple failing unit tests in the geocoding and weather services:

Corrected API key expectations in test assertions
Fixed empty query handling in geocoding service
Updated test expectations to match actual implementation behavior
Supabase Integration Testing:

User asked about existing Supabase integration tests (none existed)
Explained the difference between unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real database)
Implemented comprehensive Supabase integration tests covering:
Saving/retrieving cocktail combinations
User preferences management
Database operations like rating updates and access tracking
Proper test cleanup and authentication simulation
Current State: The project now has both unit tests for service layer logic and integration tests for database operations, providing comprehensive test coverage for the application's core functionality.

Key Technical Details: Tests use Vitest, mock external APIs for unit tests, and connect to real Supabase instance for integration testing with proper RLS policy validation.
