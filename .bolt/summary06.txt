Our conversation began with you outlining your preferences for beautiful, production-ready web designs, emphasizing the use of React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons for the SunSip application.
You then requested a comprehensive list of all mocked components, hard-coded data, and placeholder functions (excluding country drink preferences) within the application. For each item, you asked for recommendations for specific real-world services with free tiers to replace them, along with the key files that would require modification.
Most recently, you provided new image assets and instructed me to update the src/components/Room.tsx file to integrate these, which I have done, enhancing the visual layering, positioning, and parallax effects of the room scene.
