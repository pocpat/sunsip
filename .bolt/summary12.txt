Conversation Summary
Our conversation focused on fixing a scrolling behavior issue in the SunSip web application. Here's what we accomplished:
Problem Identified
The "Start Over" button was causing a jarring two-jump scroll animation when resetting the app back to the landing page, instead of a smooth single scroll motion.
Root Cause
The issue was caused by the scroll lock mechanism interfering with the smooth reset animation. When the reset was triggered, the scroll lock would immediately snap the view to a different position while the smooth scroll was trying to reach the top, creating multiple competing scroll actions.
Solution Implemented
Added isResetting state to the app store to track when a reset operation is in progress
Modified the reset function to set isResetting: true when starting a reset
Updated MainScroller to disable scroll lock during reset operations by checking the isResetting flag
Improved timing by extending the reset timeout to 1000ms to allow the smooth scroll animation to complete
Technical Changes
Enhanced the app store with reset state tracking
Modified scroll lock logic to respect the reset state
Improved the overall scrolling architecture to prevent conflicts between different scroll operations
Result
The reset now performs a single, smooth scroll animation from the results view back to the top of the landing page without any jarring jumps or interruptions.
